    brief: >
      A host is defined as a computing instance. For example, physical servers, virtual machines, switches or disk array.
    attributes:
      - id: host.id
        type: string
        stability: development
        brief: >
          Unique host ID. For Cloud, this must be the instance_id assigned by the cloud provider.
          For non-containerized systems, this should be the `machine-id`. See the table below for
          the sources to use to determine the `machine-id` based on operating system.
        examples: ['fdbf79e8af94cb7f9e8df36789187052']
      - id: host.name
        type: string
        stability: development
        brief: >
          Name of the host. On Unix systems, it may contain what the hostname
          command returns, or the fully qualified hostname, or another name
          specified by the user.
        examples: ['opentelemetry-test']
      - id: host.type
        type: string
        stability: development
        brief: >
          Type of host. For Cloud, this must be the machine type.
        examples: ['n1-standard-1']
      - id: host.image.name
        type: string
        stability: development
        brief: >
          Name of the VM image or OS install the host was instantiated from.

      - id: host.image.id
        stability: development
        type: string
        brief: >
          VM image ID or host OS image ID. For Cloud, this value is from the provider.

      - id: host.image.version
        stability: development
        type: string
        brief: >
          The version string of the VM image or host OS as defined in
          [Version Attributes](/docs/resource/README.md#version-attributes).
        examples: ['0.1']
      - id: host.ip
        stability: development
        type: string[]
        brief: >
          Available IP addresses of the host, excluding loopback interfaces.
        note: >
          IPv4 Addresses MUST be specified in dotted-quad notation. IPv6 addresses
          MUST be specified in the [RFC 5952](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5952.html) format.
        examples:
          - ["192.168.1.140", "fe80::abc2:4a28:737a:609e"]
      - id: host.mac
        stability: development
        type: string[]
        brief: >
          Available MAC addresses of the host, excluding loopback interfaces.
        note: >
          MAC Addresses MUST be represented in [IEEE RA hexadecimal form](https://standards.ieee.org/wp-content/uploads/import/documents/tutorials/eui.pdf):
          as hyphen-separated octets in uppercase hexadecimal form from most to least significant.
