## General Metrics

### Metric: `workflow.duration`

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

| Name | Instrument Type | Unit (UCUM) | Description | Stability | Entity Associations |
| -------- | --------------- | ----------- | -------------- | --------- | ------ |
| `workflow.duration` | Histogram | `s` | Duration of the workflow grouped by by the definition and outcome. | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | |

**Attributes:**

| Key | Stability | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Value Type | Description | Example Values |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`workflow.definition.name`](/docs/registry/attributes/workflow.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Required` | string | Name of the workflow | `Build and deploy application` |
| [`workflow.state`](/docs/registry/attributes/workflow.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Required` | string | The workflow goes through these states during its lifecycle. | `pending`; `executing`; `finalizing` |
| [`workflow.trigger.type`](/docs/registry/attributes/workflow.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Required` | string | Type of trigger that was called | `cron` |
| [`error.type`](/docs/registry/attributes/error.md) | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) | `Conditionally Required` If and only if the workflow execution failed. | string | Describes a class of error the operation ended with. [1] | `timeout`; `java.net.UnknownHostException`; `server_certificate_invalid`; `500` |
| [`workflow.result`](/docs/registry/attributes/workflow.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Conditionally Required` If and only if the state produces a result. | string | The result of a task run. | `success`; `failure`; `timeout`; `skipped` |
| [`workflow.platform.name`](/docs/registry/attributes/workflow.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Recommended` | string | The product being used to co-ordinate the execution of the tasks. | `hangfire`; `k8s`; `quartz` |
| [`workflow.worker.name`](/docs/registry/attributes/workflow.md) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | `Recommended` | string | Name of the host. On Unix systems, it may contain what the hostname command returns, or the fully qualified hostname, or another name specified by the user. | `opentelemetry-test` |

**[1] `error.type`:** The `error.type` SHOULD be predictable, and SHOULD have low cardinality.

When `error.type` is set to a type (e.g., an exception type), its
canonical class name identifying the type within the artifact SHOULD be used.

Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low.
Telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time when no
additional filters are applied.

If the operation has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `error.type`.

If a specific domain defines its own set of error identifiers (such as HTTP or gRPC status codes),
it's RECOMMENDED to:

- Use a domain-specific attribute
- Set `error.type` to capture all errors, regardless of whether they are defined within the domain-specific set or not.

`error.type` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.

| `skip` | The workflow was skipped, eg. due to a precondition not being met. | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

| `timeout` | The workflow has timed out resulting in no exit code being returned. | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

---

`workflow.state` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.

| Value | Description | Stability |

| `pending` | The pending state spans from the event triggering the workflow until the creation of the first task execution. [3] | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

**[1] `error.type`:** The `error.type` SHOULD be predictable, and SHOULD have low cardinality.

When `error.type` is set to a type (e.g., an exception type), its
canonical class name identifying the type within the artifact SHOULD be used.

Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low.
Telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time when no
additional filters are applied.

If the operation has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `error.type`.

If a specific domain defines its own set of error identifiers (such as HTTP or gRPC status codes),
it's RECOMMENDED to:

- Use a domain-specific attribute
- Set `error.type` to capture all errors, regardless of whether they are defined within the domain-specific set or not.
