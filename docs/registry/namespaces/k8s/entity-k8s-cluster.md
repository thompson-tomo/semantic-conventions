## K8s Cluster

**Status:** ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue)

**Type:** `k8s.cluster`

**Description:** A Kubernetes Cluster.

**Other Attributes:**

> :warning: This entity definition contains attributes without a role.

| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`k8s.cluster.name`](/docs/registry/attributes/k8s.md) | string | The name of the cluster. | `opentelemetry-cluster` | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`k8s.cluster.uid`](/docs/registry/attributes/k8s.md) | string | A pseudo-ID for the cluster, set to the UID of the `kube-system` namespace. [1] | `218fc5a9-a5f1-4b54-aa05-46717d0ab26d` | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

**[1] `k8s.cluster.uid`:** K8s doesn't have support for obtaining a cluster ID. If this is ever
added, we will recommend collecting the `k8s.cluster.uid` through the
official APIs. In the meantime, we are able to use the `uid` of the
`kube-system` namespace as a proxy for cluster ID. Read on for the
rationale.

Every object created in a K8s cluster is assigned a distinct UID. The
`kube-system` namespace is used by Kubernetes itself and will exist
for the lifetime of the cluster. Using the `uid` of the `kube-system`
namespace is a reasonable proxy for the K8s ClusterID as it will only
change if the cluster is rebuilt. Furthermore, Kubernetes UIDs are
UUIDs as standardized by
[ISO/IEC 9834-8 and ITU-T X.667](https://www.itu.int/ITU-T/studygroups/com17/oid.html).
Which states:

> If generated according to one of the mechanisms defined in Rec.
> ITU-T X.667 | ISO/IEC 9834-8, a UUID is either guaranteed to be
> different from all other UUIDs generated before 3603 A.D., or is
> extremely likely to be different (depending on the mechanism chosen).

Therefore, UIDs between clusters should be extremely unlikely to
conflict.
