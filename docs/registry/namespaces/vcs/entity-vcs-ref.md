| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`vcs.ref.head.name`](/docs/registry/attributes/vcs.md) | string | The name of the [reference](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitglossary#def_ref) such as **branch** or **tag** in the repository. [1] | `my-feature-branch`; `tag-1-test` | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`vcs.ref.head.revision`](/docs/registry/attributes/vcs.md) | string | The revision, literally [revised version](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/revision), The revision most often refers to a commit object in Git, or a revision number in SVN. [2] | `9d59409acf479dfa0df1aa568182e43e43df8bbe28d60fcf2bc52e30068802cc`; `main`; `123`; `HEAD` | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`vcs.ref.type`](/docs/registry/attributes/vcs.md) | string | The type of the [reference](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitglossary#def_ref) in the repository. | `branch`; `tag` | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

**[1] `vcs.ref.head.name`:** `head` refers to where you are right now; the current reference at a
given time.

**[2] `vcs.ref.head.revision`:** `head` refers to where you are right now; the current reference at a
given time.The revision can be a full [hash value (see
glossary)](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.186-5.pdf),
of the recorded change to a ref within a repository pointing to a
commit [commit](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit) object. It does
not necessarily have to be a hash; it can simply define a [revision
number](https://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.7/svn.tour.revs.specifiers.html)
which is an integer that is monotonically increasing. In cases where
it is identical to the `ref.head.name`, it SHOULD still be included.
It is up to the implementer to decide which value to set as the
revision based on the VCS system and situational context.
