| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`cloudfoundry.system.id`](/docs/registry/attributes/cloudfoundry.md) | string | A guid or another name describing the event source. [1] | `cf/gorouter` | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

**[1] `cloudfoundry.system.id`:** CloudFoundry defines the `source_id` in the [Loggregator v2 envelope](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/loggregator-api#v2-envelope).
It is used for logs and metrics emitted by CloudFoundry. It is
supposed to contain the component name, e.g. "gorouter", for
CloudFoundry components.

When system components are instrumented, values from the
[Bosh spec](https://bosh.io/docs/jobs/#properties-spec)
should be used. The `system.id` should be set to
`spec.deployment/spec.name`.

**[2] `cloudfoundry.system.instance.id`:** CloudFoundry defines the `instance_id` in the [Loggregator v2 envelope](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/loggregator-api#v2-envelope).
It is used for logs and metrics emitted by CloudFoundry. It is
supposed to contain the vm id for CloudFoundry components.

When system components are instrumented, values from the
[Bosh spec](https://bosh.io/docs/jobs/#properties-spec)
