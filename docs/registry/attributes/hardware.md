## Hardware Attributes

Attributes for hardware.

| Attribute | Type | Description | Examples | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| <a id="hw-cpu-arch" href="#hw-cpu-arch">`hw.cpu.arch`</a> | string | The CPU architecture the host system is running on. | `amd64`; `arm32`; `arm64` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| <a id="hw-cpu-family" href="#hw-cpu-family">`hw.cpu.family`</a> | string | Family or generation of the CPU. | `6`; `PA-RISC 1.1e` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| <a id="hw-cpu-mode" href="#hw-cpu-mode">`hw.cpu.mode`</a> | string | The mode of the CPU | `user`; `system` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| <a id="hw-cpu-stepping" href="#hw-cpu-stepping">`hw.cpu.stepping`</a> | string | Stepping or core revisions. | `1`; `r1p1` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| <a id="hw-id" href="#hw-id">`hw.id`</a> | string | An identifier for the hardware component, unique within the monitored host | `win32battery_battery_testsysa33_1` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| <a id="hw-name" href="#hw-name">`hw.name`</a> | string | An easily-recognizable name for the hardware component | `eth0` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| <a id="hw-parent" href="#hw-parent">`hw.parent`</a> | string | Unique identifier of the parent component (typically the `hw.id` attribute of the enclosure, or disk controller) | `dellStorage_perc_0` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| <a id="hw-state" href="#hw-state">`hw.state`</a> | string | The current state of the component | `ok`; `degraded`; `failed` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| <a id="hw-type" href="#hw-type">`hw.type`</a> | string | Type of the component [1] | `battery`; `cpu`; `disk_controller` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

**[1] `hw.type`:** Describes the category of the hardware component for which `hw.state` is being reported. For example, `hw.type=temperature` along with `hw.state=degraded` would indicate that the temperature of the hardware component has been reported as `degraded`.
